## Void dotfiles
Please note all of this is quite messy, I'll organize it some day 
This set of dotfiles is for some general config for my crap such as
* doom emacs
* vim 
* bpytop
* lvim/nvim
* wallpapers
* xinit
* xdefaults
* xresources
* bashrc
* neofetch 

### Scripts for
* setres (setting resolution)
* sbar (status bar for dwm in bash with xsetroot)
* setwallpaper


### Rice preview

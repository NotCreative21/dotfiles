### gentoo dotfiles
Please note all of this is quite messy, I'll organize it some day 

It has the config files for various programs I use

### Scripts for
* eth (set ethernet interface)
* setres (setting resolution)
* sbar (status bar for dwm in bash with xsetroot)
* setwall 
* setspeaker (switch the audio output through dmenu)
* setdate (change the date real quick if needed)
* screen (screenshot with scrot)
* screen2 (screenshot whole screen with scrot)

userChrome.css is a firefox theme, it's incomplete

Default ram usage with kernel config: ~74mb with xserver & 16gb ram (menuconfig)

Most of these scripts I copied to somewhere in my path (hence why they use absolute paths) so I can run them with [dmenu](https://github.com/NotCreative21/dmenu)

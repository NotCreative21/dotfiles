## Void dotfiles
Please note all of this is quite messy, I'll organize it some day 

It has the config files for various programs I use

### Scripts for
* setres (setting resolution)
* sbar (status bar for dwm in bash with xsetroot)
* setwallpaper
* setvol (set volume)
* setspeaker (switch the audio output through dmenu)
* setdate (change the date real quick if needed)

Most of these scripts I copied to somewhere in my path (hence why they use absolute paths) so I can run them with [dmenu](https://github.com/NotCreative21/dmenu)

**wm:** [dwm](https://github.com/NotCreative21/dwm)

**term:** [st](https://github.com/NotCreative21/st)

**distro:** [void](https://voidlinux.org/)

In the past I've used [slstatus](https://github.com/NotCreative21/slstatus), however I have swapped to a simple bash script (sbar) using xsetroot as a status bar

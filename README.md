## Void dotfiles
Please note all of this is quite messy, I'll organize it some day 
This set of dotfiles is for some general config for my crap such as
* vim 
* bpytop
* lvim/nvim
* wallpapers
* xinit
* xdefaults
* xresources
* bashrc
* neofetch 
* ranger
* and my brave/chrome theme :)

### Scripts for
* setres (setting resolution)
* sbar (status bar for dwm in bash with xsetroot)
* setwallpaper
* setvol (set volume)

Most of these scripts I copied to somewhere in my path (hence why they use absolute paths) so I can run them with [dmenu](https://github.com/NotCreative21/dmenu)

**wm:** [dwm](https://github.com/NotCreative21/dwm)

**term:** [st](https://github.com/NotCreative21/st)

**distro:** [void](https://voidlinux.org/)

In the past I've used [slstatus](https://github.com/NotCreative21/slstatus), however I have swapped to a simple bash script (sbar) using xsetroot as a status bar
